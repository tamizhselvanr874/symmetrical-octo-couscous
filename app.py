    - Confirm if the proposed trademark is a compound mark (combination of words/elements).
    - Deconstruct it into its formative components.
    - Example: For "POWERHOLD," identify the components "POWER" and "HOLD".
    
    FOR EACH FORMATIVE COMPONENT, perform the following detailed analysis:
    
    Step 8.b: Identical Marks Analysis for Each Component
    - PRE-FILTER: Before listing any identical trademarks, run them through the validation function.
    - Only list trademarks that are identical to each individual formative component AND cover identical or similar goods/services.
    - DO NOT include or mention any trademarks that were filtered out by the validation function.
    - Example: For "POWERHOLD," analyze "POWER" trademarks and "HOLD" trademarks separately.
    - If no identical marks pass validation for a component, state: "No identical trademarks covering similar goods/services were identified for [COMPONENT]."
    
    Step 8.c: Phonetic and Semantic Equivalents for Each Component
    - PRE-FILTER: Before listing any phonetically or semantically similar trademarks, run them through the validation function.
    - Only list trademarks that are phonetically or semantically similar to each formative component AND cover identical or similar goods/services.
    - DO NOT include or mention any trademarks that were filtered out by the validation function.
    - Example: For "POWER," phonetically similar marks might include "POWR," "POWUR," or "PAWER." For "HOLD," similar marks might include "HOALD," "HOLLD," or "HOWLD."
    - Evaluate whether these similar marks overlap in goods/services and assess the likelihood of confusion.
    
    Step 8.d: Marks with Letter Differences for Each Component
    Step 8.d.1: One-Letter Differences
    - PRE-FILTER: Before listing any trademarks with one-letter differences, run them through the validation function.
    - Only list trademarks that differ by one letter from each formative component AND cover identical or similar goods/services.
    - DO NOT include or mention any trademarks that were filtered out by the validation function.
    - Example: For "POWER," consider marks like "POWIR" or "POSER." For "HOLD," consider "HALD" or "HILD."
    - Assess the impact of these differences on consumer perception and the likelihood of confusion.
    
    Step 8.d.2: Two-Letter Differences
    - List ONLY trademarks that differ by two letters from each formative component AND cover relevant goods/services.
    - DO NOT include or mention ANY trademarks with unrelated goods/services.
    - Example: For "POWER," consider "POWTR" or "PIWER." For "HOLD," consider "HULD" or "HILD."
    - Evaluate whether these differences create confusion in meaning or pronunciation.
    - Only include marks with relevant goods/services.
    
    Step 8.e: Component Distinctiveness Analysis
    - For each component, classify its distinctiveness as Generic, Descriptive, Suggestive, Arbitrary, or Fanciful.
    - Consider the component in relation to the specific goods/services.
    - Example: For "POWER" in electrical equipment, it would be descriptive; for food services, it would be arbitrary.
    
    Step 8.f: Functional/Conceptual Relationship Analysis
    - For compound marks, analyze how the meaning of one component might relate functionally to another component in EXISTING marks.
    - Example: For "MIRAGRIP," identify marks where a component has a functional relationship similar to how "MIRA" relates to "GRIP" (e.g., "VISIONHOLD," "WONDERCLUTCH").
    - Only include marks with relevant goods/services.
    - Document the functional relationship between components and why they create similar commercial impressions.
     
    Step 8.g: Overall Component Risk Assessment
    - Provide a summary table with findings on each component:
      * Component name
      * Identical marks found
      * Phonetically/semantically similar marks found
      * Marks with letter differences found
      * Distinctiveness rating
      * Component-specific risk level (Low, Low-Medium, Medium, Medium-High, High)
    - Summarize key findings about the risks associated with each individual component.
